Font Finder - Chrome Extension
==============================

Overview
--------
Font Finder is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you identify the fonts used on any website in real-time. 
Simply activate the extension, hover over any text element, and it will display a floating tooltip showing details such as:
- Font Family
- Font Size
- Font Weight
- Font Style
- Line Height
- Color
- HTML Tag and Sample Text

You can click on any element to lock the tooltip in place and analyze it more closely. Press Escape (Esc) or deactivate the extension to exit.

- Works best on standard web pages. Some pages with strict security policies (CSP) may limit tooltip injection.
- No external requests or analytics are used — it’s 100% privacy-safe.
